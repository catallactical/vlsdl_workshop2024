class RecountMiner(Miner):
    r"""
    :author: Alberto M. Esmoris Pena

    Recount miner.
    See :class:`.Miner`.

    The recount miner considers each point in the point cloud
    :math:`\pmb{x_{i*}}` and finds either the knn or its spherical
    neighborhood :math:`\mathcal{N}`. Now, let :math:`j` index the points
    in the neighborhood. For then, a given feature :math:`f` (or reference
    value :math:`y`, e.g., classification label) can be used to filter the
    points (e.g., selecting :math:`\pmb{x}_{i*} \in \mathcal{N}` such that
    the j-th feature for the i-th points satisfies :math:`{f_i > \tau}`, for
    a given threshold :math:`\tau`. Finally, all the points in the filtered
    neighborhood can be counted in terms of absolute and relative frequency,
    and also with respect to the surface or the volume of the neighborhood
    (given by the radius of the spherical neighborhood or the distance wrt the
    closest nearest neighbor for knn neighborhoods).
